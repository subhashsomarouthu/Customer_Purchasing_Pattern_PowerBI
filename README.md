# Sports Event Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive sports event analytics project. The project involves data loading into SQL, in-depth analyses using SQL queries, and data visualization through Power BI.

## Analytical Steps
1. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Calculated key summary statistics, including unique customers, total matches held, lowest and highest ticket prices, average total amount, total revenue, and total tickets sold.

2. **Ticket Sales Analysis:**
   - Analyzed daily total sales and the number of customers for each match date to identify patterns and trends.

3. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Segmented customers into categories ('High Value,' 'Medium Value,' 'Low Value') based on total spending, providing insights into different customer segments.

4. **Source-wise Contributions:**
   - Analyzed revenue contributions from different sources, understanding the impact of each source on overall revenue.

5. **Payment Gateway Analysis:**
   - Investigated the number of transactions and customers associated with each payment gateway, providing insights into payment preferences.

6. **Most Valuable Customer:**
   - Identified and analyzed the top most valuable customers based on transaction count, average transaction amount, and total spending.

7. **Most Preferred Group by Audience:**
   - Determined the most preferred item group by the audience based on total tickets sold, total revenue, and other relevant factors.

8. **Hour of Booking Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the hourly distribution of ticket sales, identifying peak hours and trends in booking behavior.

9. **When the Customer is Booking Tickets:**
   - Explored the timing of customer bookings in relation to match dates, understanding when most tickets are sold.

10. **Total Tickets Sold on Each Booking Day:**
    - Determined the total number of tickets sold for each booking day, providing insights into booking patterns.


## Instructions
1. **SQL Scripts:**
   - The `sql_script` contains SQL scripts used for data loading and analyses.

2. **Power BI Visualizations:**
   - The `power_bi pdf` contains dashboard.
